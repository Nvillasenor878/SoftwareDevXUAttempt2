	<h1>Homework 1</h1>
	<p>	For me, I think the hardest thing that was discussed in chapter one is the concept of "Software Entropy". This is an issue to me because the author writes it out that one of the biggest factors in a group is the overall group psychology and morale. I have always struggled when working in groups for this very reason, and I worry that it will cause problems in the future of both this class and professionally. As such I tend to end up taking on more work for myself than I should, and my morale quickly falls.</p>
	<p> On the other hand, rarely do I struggle with taking responsibility, as discussed in the "My cat ate my source code" section. I am the kind of person who tries to have contingency plans for my contingency plans, so if after all that things still fall through I am well aware that I am to blame. This does occasionally cause issues, as mentioned above, when I work with others. I tend to get frustrated easily with those who dont do as theyre asked, or as theyre needed. Hopefully, this class will help me to overcome this weakness. </p>
